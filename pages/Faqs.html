                    Early lease termination is generally not recommended as it can come with penalties.  The specific terms will be outlined in your lease agreement.  Landlords may require you to pay rent for the remaining lease term or a significant portion of it.  It's always best to discuss any potential early termination directly with the landlord to see if a mutually agreeable solution can be reached.

                    Some landlords may have pet restrictions in place. These might limit the type of pet allowed (dogs vs. cats), the size of the pet, or even completely prohibit pets.  It's important to check the individual listing description for any pet restrictions or contact the landlord directly for clarification.

                    While Housing.Inc strives to connect tenants and landlords for a smooth rental experience, we don't directly resolve disputes that may arise during a lease.  Our role is to facilitate communication by providing a platform to connect interested parties.

                    The lease agreement you establish with the landlord serves as a binding contract outlining the rights and responsibilities of both parties.  Should disagreements arise, we recommend referring to the terms of the lease agreement as a first step.  Open communication and a willingness to find a compromise are often the best ways to resolve tenant-landlord conflicts.
                    
                    If further assistance is needed, there are resources available in Kigali, such as local tenant unions or mediators, who can help navigate the situation.

                Is there a security deposit required?

                    Security deposits are very common in Kigali rentals. The typical amount is usually one month's rent, but it can vary depending on the property and landlord.  This deposit is typically returned to the tenant at the end of the lease term, minus any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear.
